Difference between customer who did and did not accept the coupon offers

Based on the data analysis and visualization of the data we have created the following report for customer characteristics and behavior. This report provides a comparison of customer who accepted the coupon vs the ones who did not. Its highlights the key difference in characteristic and behavior of the customers and its acceptance rate. Our findings show some significant differences that could help to tailor future marketing plans, recommendation (personalization) for coupons to customers.
Key Findings for Bar Coupon using single and multivariable analysis 	
Customer age: The customers who accepted the coupons were older, more than a 50% were age 25 or above. On the opposite end of the acceptance spectrum, young consumers ages 18 to 24 evinced low acceptance rate
Action : Our coupon offering system should target driver who goes to bar/coffeehouse more than once a month than the one who never goes. Also target drivers who are older 21 than years old

 
Frequency of Bar Visits: Interestingly, there was a major difference in how often customers went to bars. Coupon acceptance was significantly higher for customers who had visited a bar more than once in the previous month (76%) than among those who rarely or never went to one (37%)

Passenger Profile: Adult passengers (i.e. non-kids) coupon had higher acceptance rate for bar coupon, while child passengers had an acceptance rate of only 29%. This indicates that the passenger mix could impact coupon acceptance.

Occupation: Driver with occupations that were non-farming, fishing or forestry were more likely to use the bar coupons. Below graphs shows, occupation like architecture & engineering, healthcare support and production occupation has highest acceptance rate. Whereas occupation as retired has no acceptance rate. Hence targeting specific occupation demographic can increase chances of coupon acceptance. 
  
Income Levels: Driver with low income below $50K as well as very high income above 100K are more likely to use a bar coupon than others. This shows that income level has crucial role in coupon acceptance behavior. We can do further analysis on this to 
Action : Markets offers for low-income driver who frequently goes to cheaper restaurants.

 
Weather and Timing: Consequently, coupon acceptance rates peaked during sunny weather and after 6 PM — which showcases that external factor plays a role in coupon acceptance rate.
