Its highlights the key difference in characteristic and behavior of the customers and its acceptance rate. Our findings show some significant differences that could help to tailor future marketing plans, recommendation (personalization) for coupons to customers.

**Key Findings for Bar Coupon using single and multivariable analysis 	**
**Customer age:** The customers who accepted the coupons were older, more than a 50% were age 25 or above. On the opposite end of the acceptance spectrum, young consumers ages 18 to 24 evinced low acceptance rate
Action : Our coupon offering system should target driver who goes to bar/coffeehouse more than once a month than the one who never goes. Also target drivers who are older 21 than years old
